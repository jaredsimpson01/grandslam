# GrandSlam – Alternative Investment Portfolio Site

A sleek, multi-page website for a boutique investment firm, designed to showcase asymmetric return strategies and portfolio diversification. Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **CSS**, the site features responsive design, smooth anchor navigation, dropdown menus, and elegant theming.

Note: This is a real-world project built for my dad's investment company and will be actively used as the firm's public-facing website.
